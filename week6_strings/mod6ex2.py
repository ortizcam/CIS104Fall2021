If 'fruit' is the string in question, fruit[:] is really just indicating...
fruit. No positions are given on either side, so if you were to print that to
screen, you would just get fruit. Where as if you were to list position numbers
on either side of the semicolon, say 1 and 3, it would print from 1 up to 3.
